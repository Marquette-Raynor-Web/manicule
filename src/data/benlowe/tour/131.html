	<p>At stanza 61, the poet takes over the text again and Jesus enters, “ a comely Person, clad in white” — her bridegroom. “Give, give me Children, or I die!,”  Theophila cries to Jesus; “Love, rest / Thy Head upon the Pillows of my Breast! / When me Thou shalt impregn’d with Vertues make / A fruitful Eden, All the Frutage take!” Later, in an erotic fit modeled after verse by Richard Crashaw, she “lay with flaming Love empierc’t to the Heart: / Wak’t, As She bled, She kist the Dart; / Then sigh’d. Take all as I am, or have! All, All Thou art!”
