<p>This anthology exemplifies the porous boundary between manuscript and print textual traditions in late-fifteenth-century Europe, and more broadly, the textual fluidity that is characteristic of many manuscripts. It contains material from numerous manuscript sources and three incunables, or fifteenth-century print texts: Johannes Lichtenberger’s <em>Prognosticatio</em>, and two editions of Johannes Regiomontanus’s <em>Calendarium</em>. Many of the texts are incomplete, and later doodles and pen trials are scattered through the codex. </p>
<p>The drawings on this leaf were likely produced c. 1589 by the young Veit Engelhard Holtzschuher (1581-1656), the son of a Nuremberg patrician, whose name appears on a number of other pages in this volume (3v, 95v, 96r, 125r, 130v, 177r).</p>
