	<p>About fifty stanzas into Canto 2, the heroine Theophila finally enters, “unhing’d with Fear, / Clamm’d with chill sweat” at her sinfulness. In the accompanying etching by Barlow she kneels in prayer “Besieg’d with deadly Sinnes” in the form of gnarling boars, tigers, and dragons. She weeps with shame and prostrates herself before God. Note the typography: her prayers are set apart in italics in the text. </p>
