<p>This is the beginning of a treatise on the constellations attributed to Kaspar Engelsüss and based on descriptions by Michael Scotus (or Scot; 1174-c. 1232), court astrologer to Frederick II. A prominent mathematician, philosopher, and translator, Scotus developed a much-copied list of 36 constellations (although this version only includes 35) in his <em>Liber introductorius</em>, including two – Tarabellum and Vexillum, or the Drill and Standard – that he invented. This text once included 35 coloured pen drawings, of which 16 remain intact, including this representation of Ursa Major. All others have been partly or completely cut out of the book.</p>
