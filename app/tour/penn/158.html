<p>This calendar for Augsburg provides a good example of the hierarchy of scripts that gave rise to the modern phrase “red-letter day”: the most important feasts and holidays are written in red ink. The letters in the small column toward the left of each page (A through G) are “dominical letters.” Each year was assigned a dominical letter, which indicated when Sundays were to fall. For example, in a year assigned the dominical letter E, the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin (line 7 on this page, and February 2nd) would fall on a Sunday.</p>
