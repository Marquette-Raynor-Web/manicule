<p>This short sequence of striking eclipse diagrams, a feature of most copies of the <em>Calendarium</em>, provides the times, dates, and durations of lunar and solar eclipses between 1475 and 1518. Total eclipses are represented by black discs, while partial eclipses are black and yellow. Printing these diagrams in two colours was a labour-intensive process requiring two woodblocks, making a manuscript copy an attractive alternative.</p>
