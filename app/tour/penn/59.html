    Authorial presentation was something Benlowes put great energy and care into as both a poet and a patron, and he left us
    several portraits that he designed and even printed himself, in collaboration with the engraver Francis Barlow. One of
    the most illustrative -- and a fitting counterpoint to his critics -- is the first plate of his master-work Theophila.
    It is worth considering it in some detail, as condensed into its frame is an emblem of his authorship as Benlowes himself
    wanted it to be known.

    The engraving features two central figures: Theophila and a young man. Following the tradition of Joseph Beaumont’s Psyche
    and Henry More’s Psychozoia, Theophila is the feminized Platonic soul, sovereign over the body, and so, appropriately,
    she is clothed in the trappings of a queen. A thick, ermine-lined robe wraps her body; she holds a cross-bearing orb
    and glances upward toward heaven as an angel lowers a crown onto her head. Of course, in the immediate aftermath of the
    Civil Wars, these symbols of monarchy would gesture at more than a Neo-Platonic theology, and it is hard not to imagine
    Royalist readers seeing in her beatific gaze an echo of King Charles the Martyr, beheaded just three years before the
    book’s publication. Although this is less evident in the engraving alone, she is also a figure for Benlowes himself,
    serving as his female co-author and divine collaborator in the “sacrifice” narrated by the poem. It is her voice that
    breaks through in Canto xx when the poet-narrator’s fails, her eyes that see the “Heav’nly Sphere,” a realm that he can
    only strive to reproduce imperfectly in verse. In short, she mediates his mortal relation to the divine -- as a soul,
    spiritually, and as a sovereign, politically. By projecting onto Theophila his own authorship, Benlowes creates for himself,
    and perhaps also for his late King, a female double whose journey to absolution mirrors his own struggle to overcome
    earthly desires. Her “PNEUMATO-SARCO-MACHIA” -- the title of a preliminary text, meaning literally “Spirit-Flesh-War”
    -- is his own.

    Opposite Theophila is a curly-haired young man, another double for Benlowes himself (who in fact would have been nearly fifty
    by the time Theophila was published). His foot rests on the world, a sign of his indifference to earthly matters, and
    his back is to the reader — a pose Benlowes often struck in his portraits, preferring to style himself as a humble servant
    to poesy rather than its master. In Barlow’s portrait, for instance, Benlowes glances over his shoulder at the viewer;
    in another, an oil painting that he gave to St Johns College in —-, he turns his face away and points instead to an open
    book. The verse accompanying the image calls this figure the “Author,” and he holds a quill as if writing; yet he gazes
    at his subject in a way that suggests he is actually sketching her portrait, and elsewhere in the preface Benlowes styles
    himself a “Composer,” a word with echoes both in music and printing. Here, the labor of poetic composition mirrors the
    process of visual reproduction and musical creativity, perhaps even the task of setting type, like a compositor, or engraving
    a plate to be printed. In these synaesthetic shifts from Author to Composer, from poetry to portraiture, Benlowes frames
    his own creativity as a process of making, fashioning, and figuring the divine -- of adorning and dressing it in ornate
    trappings suitable to such a transcendent subject, much as the women of Little Gidding saw their own work in the Harmonies.
    Together, the laboring Composer and the sovereign Theophila form a dyadic portrait of Benlowes’ authorship, two sides
    of his “Fancy”: on the one hand, the transcendent “Masculine and refined Pleasures of the Understanding,” as he outlines
    it in his preface; on the other, the “feminine and sensual” pleasures “of the Eye” (sig. [xx]). He is “E. B.,” as Benlowes
    calls himself on the title page, labeling his work with his initials like a craftsman or copyist, indeed as his own printer
    does on the same page; she is THEOPHILA, a woman, his soul, a book, even a martyred King packed into one refulgent symbol.

    The product of this authorial coupling is the book Theophila, which flies above the two figures clutched in the talons of
    an eagle. The eagle is the symbol of John the Evangelist, and the pairing of a youthful, effeminate man writing near
    such a bird would likely have spurred in readers’ minds a parallel between the Composer and this most mystical of the
    evangelists. Like John, Benlowes dwells less in the realm of narrative synopsis and more on the divinity of ascension.
    An eagle carrying something in its talons may also have specifically suggested to readers the myth of Ganymede, the beautiful
    Greek shepherd boy kidnapped by Zeus. Smitten with the boy, Zeus disguised himself as an eagle to steal Ganymede away
    to Olympus, where he raped him and forced into the god’s servitude. The story was “the best known myth of homoerotic
    desire in early modern England,” as Bruce Smith has pointed out, especially desire between masters and their male servants.
    The hint of it in this engraving, with the beautiful boy Ganymede transformed into Benlowes’s book, suggests the extent
    to which the poet may have seen the material form of the codex as participating in the Crashavian erotics of his verse.
    Here, not just Theophila the soul but Theophila the book has become physically charged, a beautiful thing desired; indeed,
    following the Ganymede myth, it is precisely because the book is so captivating that it is able to transcend the mundane
    scene of its own writing and rapturously ascends to the heavens. What others would later see as Benlowes’ queer fetish
    for form and ornament is here presented as the very reason his work is able to touch the divine.
