<p>This table in the <em>Calendarium</em> compares cases where the date of Easter “Iuxta vsu[m] ecclesie” (according to ecclesiastical practice) conflicts with the mathematically determined date of Easter “Iuxta decreta patru[m]” (according to the decrees of the fathers). In a period of fifty-five years, Regiomontanus identifies 30 such cases, highlighting the need for calendrical reform. Calculating the exact date of Easter was an ongoing challenge for astronomers throughout the Middle Ages, and Regiomontanus was eventually summoned to Rome to assist with reforming the ecclesiastical calendar. Unfortunately, he spent only a few months in Rome before dying in July 1476, possibly from the plague.</p>
