<p>The instrument on this page of Regiomontanus’s text originally had a volvelle, or moveable circular diagram, with two concentric discs attached at the centre of the image. Volvelles were fragile and frequently lost. For an intact version, see the image from Ratdolt’s 1482 edition on the University of Glasgow Special Collections website: <a href="http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/aug1999.html">http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/aug1999.html</a>. </p>
<p>In the unequal or seasonal hour system, which was common in the Middle Ages, day and night were each divided into twelve hours; thus an hour of daylight was not equivalent to an hour of night. Astrolabes often had a scale of equal hours around the outside edge, with a diagram like this one permitting the user to calculate the unequal hours. </p>
