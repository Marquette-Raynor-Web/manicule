<p>The “golden numbers” described on this page were used in medieval perpetual calendars that were valid for many years; given the costs of materials and labour involved in producing a medieval manuscript, it would have been impractical to produce new calendars every year. Golden numbers were assigned to each year based on the timing of their new moons. To calculate the golden number of a given year, divide the year by 19, then take the remainder and add 1.</p>
