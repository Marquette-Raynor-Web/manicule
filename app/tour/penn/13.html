<div>
	<p>This is another tour stop.</p>
	<p>To add more tour stops, create an HTML file like this one, with a basic div container; name it using the index number of the page you'd like to attach the tour stop to; and add the file to the /tour/{name of your book -- the default in the reader is "penn"}/.</p>
	<p>Be sure to update the tour.json file in the same folder, which orders the tour. A tour can zigzag non-linearly across a book, but you must update the JSON file.</p>
