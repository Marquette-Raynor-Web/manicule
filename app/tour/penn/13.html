    This image, found in many extant copies of Theophila, was not cut originally for the book. Instead, it comes from Wenseslaus
    Hollar's Four Seasons, a series of portraits of women showing their dress in summer, spring, fall, and winter. This woman
    is the winter woman. The paper quality is different from the rest of the book, and it is likely that Benlowes bought
    up old stock of this portrait from a printseller to include in made-up copies of Theophila, rather than having them re-printed.

    In Theophila, the image is often opposed to a poem urging ladies against vanity. The juxtaposition of image and poem reorients
    the image — originally just a depiction of a woman in winter garb — to imply that women should cover themselves spiritually
    as they do in winter physically. This portrait is a prime example of how Benlowes repurposes found and familiar images."
