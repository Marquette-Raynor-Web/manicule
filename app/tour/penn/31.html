These unusual woodcut letters come from a surprisingly old source: an erotic alphabet cut by the artist Peter Fl√∂tner around 1534. It's uncertain why Benlowes' printers would have access to these particular woodcuts, or how they relate to the poem; they may be copies. Their use here is another example of Benlowes repurposing older materials to new ends, and suggest the more general erotic mysticism of Benlowes' verse.
