<p>First printed in 1488, Johannes Lichtenberger’s <em>Prognosticatio</em> quickly became an influential text, reflecting the widespread popularity of prophetic literature in the decades leading up to the Reformation. This book of astrological predictions about the fate of the Church and the Holy Roman Empire draws on earlier writings by prophets such as Birgitta of Sweden and Joachim of Fiore. Lichtenberger also included an apocalyptic prophecy concerning the “great conjunction” of Saturn and Jupiter in November 1484. The <em>Prognosticatio</em> remained popular in the sixteenth century, and inspired commentaries by Martin Luther and Paracelsus (Theophrastus von Hohenheim) in the 1520s.</p>
<p>The rubricated title in this manuscript, “Prenosticatio zu teutstch,” indicates that this is a German version of Lichtenberger's text, likely based on the first print translation (Heidelberg, 1490). As in many other manuscripts, the scribe left space for a specialized artist to add the initial “D,” but this letter instead appears to have been inexpertly supplied by a reader. </p>
