  Designed and etched by Francis Barlow for Theophila, this portrait shows a young Edward Benlowes. The author looks younger than he no doubt would have when the book was published in 1652 , when he was fifty-two. The youthfulness of the image may reflect the time of the text’s composition two decades earlier, when Benlowes was in his thirties (see engraving 1). Note also his stance. Benlowes glances over his shoulder, a pose he often struck in his portraits, preferring to style himself as a humble servant to poesy rather than its master. In another oil painting that he gave to St Johns College, for instance, he turns his face away from the viewer and points instead to an open book.

When Benlowes’s authorial portrait was copied in the eighteenth century, around the time his name became synonymous with slimy patronage, the engraver stripped away the Apollonian wreath, putti, and strapwork encrusting his image, leaving only his bust against a darkened background. This is a move that critics and detractors would repeat often in attempts to render Benlowes legible as an author. It is the task of my own reading to knit a new image of the poet -- one that restores his ornamentalism and takes seriously, as he and his companions did, the fierce armature of his verse.
