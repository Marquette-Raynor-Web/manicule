	<p>When this authorial portrait of Edward Benlowes was copied in the eighteenth century, the engraver stripped away the Apollonian wreath, putti, and strapwork encrusting his image, leaving only his bust against a darkened background. This is a move that critics and detractors would repeat often in attempts to render Benlowes legible as an author. It’s the aim of this digital tour to restore to Benlowes his ornamental framework and take seriously the role such embellishments play in his poetics.

	<p>The point of doing so isn’t to improve Benlowes’ reputation as a poet so much as shift the grounds upon which we read his or any other literary production in the seventeenth century. Pivoting our gaze away from naked texts and toward intimate entanglements with media technologies — and attending to our own digital engagements as we do — we find Benlowes not alone on the page but in his domestic printing atelier at Brent Hall in Finchingfield, surrounded by unbound books, copper-plates, a rolling press, gold sheets for gilding covers, and his companion Jan Schoren. There, they cultivated a network of poets, printers, engravers, and composers, all collaborating on bespoke, almost scribal assemblages of printed texts, images, even music. He leaves florid Latin inscriptions in the cartouche on his portrait for friends, presses elaborate symbols onto the blank pages of Phineas Fletcher’s work, produces the century’s most popular book of emblems with Francis Quarles, and, as his world crashes into civil war, tucks fragments of the old prints into the gathered folds of his masterpiece <em>Theophila</em> (1652), the book you see here. Emerging from these collaborations is new way of thinking about books in the period.
